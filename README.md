# Test Assignment Project

## Description

This project is a simple Android application built using Kotlin Native. It demonstrates the integration of key Android technologies such as Retrofit, Dagger Hilt, Coroutines, and RecyclerView. The app fetches data from an API and displays it in a `RecyclerView` list. Upon clicking a list item, the app navigates to a details page, where it fetches additional information from the API using the selected item's ID.

The app is fully responsive, supporting both portrait and landscape orientations, and includes light and dark mode themes.
